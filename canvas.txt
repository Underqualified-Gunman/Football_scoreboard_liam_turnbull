Unit Assignment 4 â€“ More Object-Oriented Coding Practice

Using C++ Object Oriented classes to create a Football Scoreboard. Is not a Scoreboard a Menu?

 Task

First, decide which method you will use for class declarations in this project Scope Resolution or alternative--either is fine, but once you commit, run with it. 

Keep reading to the Need help getting started? section!!! 

1.       Create a Top Level Folder called: Football_Scoreboard_YourFirstName_YourLastName to store all of the work.

2.       Create a CPP within your top-level folder called: Football_Scoreboard.cpp  (or main.cpp if using an online IDE like Repl.it) 

3.       In the comments, give your name credit, class, date, and teacher.

4.       Your objective is to create C++ program that keeps track of various objects and variables in a Football Scoreboard.

5.      
          Create a class called Scoreboard.

          Write the appropriate member variables, setter functions, and getter functions to make the scoreboard work.
In int main()

*        Create 2 instances of the Team Class (Objects) (any two teams you like, any home team set you like)

*        Show the scoreboard with the various values initialized to zero

*        Make the scoreboard functional and able to be updated with your input from the keyboard.




This code assumes 1 Scoreboard instance and 2 Team instances. 
  Tier 1 Extra challenges: 

*        Extra Challenge: Show the Team Name and City on your Scoreboard.

      Extra Challenge: Define the Classes in a .h file, and refer to them in int main(). This is more clean design. 

      Extra Challenge: Any thoughts on how to get the clock to work, set, reset, start, stop...?  

 

  Tier 2 Extra challenges:  

+3 Extra Credit if Team T1 and Team T2 are members of the Scoreboard Class.

Can we unify the Scoreboard class to have Team classes as members? A great idea from McMillanite, Joshua Bair. 

See perhaps: http://www.cplusplus.com/ forum/general/67828/ (Links to an external site.)
 
I want to be able to declare statements in int main() like so...

Scoreboard s1; //assuming T1 and T2 as public members

s1.T1.setName("Dallas Cowboys"); 
s1.T2.setName("Houston Texans");   

      Scoreboard s1; //assuming T1 and T2 as private members passed as parameters accessed with setters and getters

s1.Team1().setName("Dallas Cowboys"); 
s1.Team2().setName("Houston Texans");
