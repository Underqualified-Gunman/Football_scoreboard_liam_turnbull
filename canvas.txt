Unit Assignment 4 – More Object-Oriented Coding Practice

Using C++ Object Oriented classes to create a Football Scoreboard. Is not a Scoreboard a Menu?

 

Rubric:

Code 70 points: Zip (or online IDE Share URL) file of the entire solution Folder including GitHub Share URL. 

 

Version Control and Git Hub Requirement: 
Create a GitHub Account (if needed at)  https://github.com/ (Links to an external site.)

The Repl.it IDE is recommended: https://replit.com/new/cpp (Links to an external site.)

Using the "Version Control" button on the left in the Repl.it IDE, connect the current program to your GitHub Account 
Save commit, and keep track of your project as you work on this homework 

Note your GitHub URL as you will need to supply this to Dr_T with your code share link, for instance, this is my link:  https://github.com/drtmcmillanite (Links to an external site.)

Study Live Lecture 4 (Download and Save here) (Links to an external site.)  - Repl.it Dr_T sample Scoreboard code: https://repl.it/@TysonMcMillan/SoccerScoreboardDrTCPPCOSC-1437 (Links to an external site.)

Study Closely the Gaddis Rectangle Class and Rectangle Instance in:Use the examples for inspiration on how to approach solving the following item.

COSC_1437_NOTES/ 8_Week_Agendas/Week2_8week_Agenda/Gaddis_Rectangle_Class/Rectangle_Class.cpp
COSC_1437_NOTES/ 8_Week_Agendas/Week2_8week_Agenda/Gaddis_Rectangle_Class/Rectangle_Instance.cpp
Look at this live implementation of the Rectangle Code per Gaddis. Scope Resolution Operator method:

Look at this live alternative implementation of the Rectangle code using a more concise method of class declaration:

 Task

First, decide which method you will use for class declarations in this project Scope Resolution or alternative--either is fine, but once you commit, run with it.

1.       Create a Top Level Folder called: Football_Scoreboard_YourFirstName_YourLastName to store all of the work.

2.       Create a CPP within your top-level folder called: Football_Scoreboard.cpp  (or main.cpp if using an online IDE like Repl.it) 

3.       In the comments, give your name credit, class, date, and teacher.

4.       Your objective is to create C++ program that keeps track of various objects and variables in a Football Scoreboard.

 

 



5.      

 Create a C++ Object Oriented Class called Team. A team has member variables:

*        Name

*        Coach_Name

*        Home_City

*        Home_Status (bool true or false; if true, Home Team, if false, visitor)

*        Score (holding the current score)

*        Timeout_Count

6.       Write the appropriate setter and getter member functions for the Team Class.

          Create a class called Scoreboard.

          Write the appropriate member variables, setter functions, and getter functions to make the scoreboard work.


In int main()

*        Create 2 instances of the Team Class (Objects) (any two teams you like, any home team set you like)

*        Show the scoreboard with the various values initialized to zero

*        Make the scoreboard functional and able to be updated with your input from the keyboard.

See my extra hints for this same program written in Java. You will of, course, have to translate the code to C++ and fill in the functionality that I did not write.

This code assumes 1 Scoreboard instance and 2 Team instances.

Open the BlueJ Package 
Right Click and Run the Main.java by clicking Void Main String args
Using setters and getters via Encapsulation to help us get to the desired goal. (Observe: Scoreboard.java, Team.java, Main.java)

  Tier 1 Extra challenges: 

*        Extra Challenge: Show the Team Name and City on your Scoreboard.

      Extra Challenge: Define the Classes in a .h file, and refer to them in int main(). This is more clean design. 

      Extra Challenge: Any thoughts on how to get the clock to work, set, reset, start, stop...?  

 

  Tier 2 Extra challenges:  

+3 Extra Credit if Team T1 and Team T2 are members of the Scoreboard Class.

Can we unify the Scoreboard class to have Team classes as members? A great idea from McMillanite, Joshua Bair. 

See perhaps: http://www.cplusplus.com/ forum/general/67828/ (Links to an external site.)
 
I want to be able to declare statements in int main() like so...

Scoreboard s1; //assuming T1 and T2 as public members

s1.T1.setName("Dallas Cowboys"); 
s1.T2.setName("Houston Texans");   

      Scoreboard s1; //assuming T1 and T2 as private members passed as parameters accessed with setters and getters

s1.Team1().setName("Dallas Cowboys"); 
s1.Team2().setName("Houston Texans");

Submission Process: 

In the "written submission/comments" Provide Dr_T the Live URL share of

1) Repl.it share URL, and (open in new window target = _blank)

2) the URL of your GitHub repository  (open in new window target = _blank)

If using an IDE other than Repl.it, provide Dr_T with the zip file submission of your code.

 

Or if Zipping, be sure to zip your entire top-level solution folder….
